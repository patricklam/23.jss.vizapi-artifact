Goal (why did we produce this data?):
investigate API usage patterns, both conceptually and in practice

Dimensions of data: what, how, which way, why not (section 2.1 in thesis)

Implementation details (section 2.3.1 in thesis)

Benchmarks (section 2.3.2 in thesis)

Potential Applications:
Security: 
Identify illegal accesses and abnormal usage
Identify propagated vulnerabilities from dependencies
Developer experience: analyze dataset for improving experience of library users
Help library developers identify which features to focus efforts on
Predict good choices of libraries based on client use case
Analyze library version usage
How does static and dynamic usage differ?
(other ML applications of the data??)
