\label{sec:artifacts}
We have archived our artifacts for
\begin{itemize}
\item static and dynamic analysis tool generating data for VizAPI: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/8104759}
\item VizAPI: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7023911}
\item dataset: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7023872}
\end{itemize}
For those who seek to build on our artifact, we have made both
our static and dynamic analysis tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SruthiVenkat/calls-across-libs}}
and VizAPI\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SruthiVenkat/api-visualization-tool}}
available as public GitHub reposiitories, though the version of record is at zenodo.
