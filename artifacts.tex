\section{Artifacts}
\label{sec:artifacts}
We have archived our artifacts for the two parts of VizAPI:
\begin{itemize}
\item Static and dynamic analysis tool to generate data: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/8104759}
\item Data visualization tool: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7023911}
\item Dataset: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7023872}
\end{itemize}
For those who seek to build on our artifact, we have made both
our static and dynamic analysis tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SruthiVenkat/calls-across-libs}}
and the visualization tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SruthiVenkat/api-visualization-tool}}
available as public GitHub repositories, though the version of record is at Zenodo.
