\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have discussed the design and implementation of our
VizAPI artifact. VizAPI collects static and dynamic information
about interactions between components (clients, libraries, and dependencies) and makes
it visible to developers. We hope that our discussions will be of value
to future researchers who are looking to design static and dynamic
code analysis and visualization tools. In the future we would also like
to conduct some user studies with developers to evaluate the effectiveness of our artifact.
