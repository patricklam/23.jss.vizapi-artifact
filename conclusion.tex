\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have discussed the design and implementation of our
VizAPI artifact. VizAPI collects static and dynamic information
about dependencies between components (libraries and clients) and makes
it visible to developers. We hope that our discussions will be of value
to future researchers who are looking to design static and dynamic
code analysis tools.
